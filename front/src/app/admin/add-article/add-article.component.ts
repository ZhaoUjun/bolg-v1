    "**This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "In development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "If you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.\n" +

    "## Post-Processing CSS\n" +
    "\n" +
    "This project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you donâ€™t need to worry about it.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "For example, this:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "```css\n" +
    ".App {\n" +
    "  display: flex;\n" +
    "  flex-direction: row;\n" +
    "  align-items: center;\n" +
